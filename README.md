# 🍽️ Restaurant Reservation - OCL Component Specification

This repository contains the **Object Constraint Language (OCL) Component Specifications** for the *Restaurant Reservation System* developed as part of the final project for the course **Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE)**.

## 📌 Overview

The goal of this project is to model the key components of a Restaurant Reservation System using precise and formal **OCL specifications**. These components are part of a modular system architecture designed to manage table reservations efficiently.

## 🧩 OCL Components

The project includes three primary OCL interface specifications:

| Interface ID     | Description                                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `IMejaMgt`       | Handles operations related to table (meja) management, such as adding and updating available tables. |
| `IReservasiMgt`  | Manages customer reservations, including creation, updating, and cancellation. |
| `IUserMgt`       | Manages user-related actions, both for User and Admin.|

Each interface contains method signatures, preconditions, postconditions, and invariants as required by OCL standards.
